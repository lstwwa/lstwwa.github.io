<p>Nowadays,there are more and more chances to work abroad since our country has intensive cooperation with many other countries. However, working abroad is still not very attractive to most undergraduates even if their teachers <u><strong>1.F) actively</strong></u>  encourage them to take it into serious consideration. So, why do teachers think students should contemplate working abroad? Here are the reasons.</p>
<p>Working abroad will make you more independent. As we all know, working abroad means having a long journey by air, working with foreign <u><strong>2.A) colleagues</strong></u>,  living closely with local people and being far away from families and friends, etc. You are forced to be more independent than ever before, since you are always in a new and strange environment.</p>
<p>Working abroad will <u><strong>3.M) provide</strong></u> you with excellent experiences to add to your CV or resume. You are more likely to stand out among your competitors, because working abroad shows that you are  <u><strong>4.O)adaptable</strong></u> to new conditions and are able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>Working abroad will <u><strong>5.C) expose</strong></u>  you to many new things, especially language. It is no exaggeration to say that the more countries you work in, the more languages you can master. <u><strong>6.J)Furthermore</strong></u> , with the learning of new languages, you can get <u><strong>7.D)access</strong></u> to new cultures. Knowing much about various cultures is an excellent talent in today‚Äôs multicultural environment. When you return home, you will have more strings to your bow.</p>
<p>Working abroad will widen your <u><strong>8.B)horizons</strong></u>. Anyhow, working abroad is totally different from travelling abroad. You are not a tourist for enjoying leisure time. You have to work, at least a long while, as a local people. Imagine yourself as a <u><strong>9.I)_permanent</strong></u> resident of a foreign country and try to understand those people around in a serious way. Step by step, you will be familiar with their diets, habits, manners, expressions and even ideologies.</p>
<p>It is understandable that students are afraid of <u><strong>10.L)uprooting</strong></u> themselves and taking unknown risk to work in a foreign country. However, think about the advantages of working abroad, which will offer you many opportunities that you can‚Äôt imagine if you haven‚Äôt had such kind of experience, and take a try.</p>

<p>When you enter a foreign country, you have to go through the immigration inspection.Each country has its <u><strong>1.E)unique</strong></u>policies governing the inspection process.For most passengers, the immigration inspection only takes a short time.</p>
<p>The passengers waiting in the immigration area will be separated into two lines, one for host-country  <u><strong>2.F)nationals</strong></u>, and the other for international visitors. When it is your turn, you will be asked to show your passport, and sometimes will be asked how long you plan on visiting and where you will stay. </p>
<p>When you are going to enter the U.S., you will also be required to provide your photograph and the  <u><strong>3.H)fingerprints</strong></u>of all your 10 fingers if you are a visitor. When everything is done, officers will <u><strong>4.A)stamp</strong></u> your passport, which means you are approved to enter this country.</p>
<p>After clearing immigration and <u><strong>5.I)claiming</strong></u> your baggage, you will need to proceed through customs before being allowed to exit the airport. Customs is the authority that is responsible for managing the flow of goods, especially restrictive and prohibited ones. Each country has its own laws and regulations <u><strong>6.C)applicable</strong></u> to goods into and out of it. As an international visitor, it is  <u><strong>7.L) critical</strong></u> to be aware of the laws and regulations of the country you enter and  <u><strong>8.D)comply</strong></u> with them.</p>
<p>While you are on your flight, the stewards and stewardesses will hand out a customs declaration form to you.You will need to fill in your basic personal and travel information like your name, country of <u><strong>9.J)residence</strong></u>, passport number, flight number, and countries you visit, etc. Meanwhile, there will be a few ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù questions about what items you are bringing with you. Custom officials may or may not inspect your luggage.If they do check your bags and find restricted or prohibited items, you may be asked to pay duty and&#x2F;or fines. So be sure to  <u><strong>10.G)declare</strong></u> all items as required, which will ensure that your customs process is as smooth and speedy as possible.If everything is fine,you are free to exit the airport.</p>

<p>Banks accept and safeguard deposits, and then lend out this money to people who need it.  <u><strong>1.C)Besides</strong></u>, banks also provide a variety of other financial services for <u><strong>2.H) individuals</strong></u> and businesses. A businessman‚Äôs experience with a bank may show you some of the banking businesses.</p>
<p>Jack has a small business. Every month, he deposits a certain amount of money into his savings account at a bank for future use. At the same time, the bank pays him <u><strong>3.I)_interest</strong></u>. In order to facilitate payment, he opens a cheque account in the bank which allows him to <u><strong>4.A)withdraw</strong></u> money freely and pay digitally. Sometimes he has to place an order with a foreign company and in this case, a letter of credit will be helpful. The bank that writes the letter of credit will act on behalf of him and make sure that the seller can receive the payment if the <u><strong>5.B)delivery</strong></u>of goods is completed as required.</p>
<p>When Jack ‚Äòs business <u><strong>6.F)expands</strong></u>, he needs more funds. He considers approaching a bank for financial support.To convince the bank that he is a trustworthy borrower, Jack demonstrates his business plan and credit record to the bank. </p>
<p>Being convinced, the bank offers him some options of loans based on his needs. Considering the lower interest rate, Jack chooses a <u><strong>7.G)secured</strong></u> loan with his house as collateral. When he feels at a loss for his business,he also goes to his bank for advice. Moreover, if he wants to protect his <u><strong>8.M) valuable</strong></u> belongings like jewellery,important documents, etc. in case there is a fire or robbery at his house, he can rent a safe deposit locker from the bank by paying a certain rent.</p>
<p>Besides all the above services Jack has been <u><strong>9.J)provided</strong></u> by a bank while doing his business, there are many other services available at the bank. In some cases, banks help people with all transactions they have to do.Therefore, with a bank, things become typically more convenient and <u><strong>10.E)efficient</strong></u>.</p>

<p>Signing a lease agreement is not something that can be done lightly. You need to <u><strong>1.F)deliberate</strong></u> when signing it because you should be responsible for your money and your life during the lease period. You may need to follow the recommended <u><strong>2.G)procedure</strong></u> below to help you make sure that you are in the best position of not only understanding all elements of a lease agreement, but also<u><strong>3.E)ensuring</strong></u> it is in your best interests. </p>
<p>Arrange to have a copy of the lease agreement <u><strong>4.D)delivered</strong></u> to you at least a day or two in advance of signing it. Many people make the mistake of not taking a look at the lease agreement until the very time that it is to be signed. You cannot fully review a document like a lease agreement on the spot.</p>
<p><u><strong>5.C)Review</strong></u> the basic elements of the lease agreement to ensure that they are in line with what you orally agreed to. These elements include the monthly rent, the terms of payment, and<u><strong>6.B)penalties</strong></u> for failing to pay the rent in a timely manner. </p>
<p>Verify the date listed in the lease agreement that you are <u><strong>7.A)entitled</strong></u> to take possession of the property. Make sure the lease agreement includes a provision to penalize the landlord if the premises are not accessible on the date promised.</p>
<p>Examine the <u><strong>8.L)provision</strong></u> in the lease agreem ent pertaining to changes and alterations you can make to the premises.</p>
<p><u><strong>9.N)Confirm</strong></u> that the lease agreement contains a provision on renewal that is agreed during the discussions pertaining to it.</p>
<p><u><strong>10.O)Schedule</strong></u> a specific time when both you and the other party can present yourselves for signing the lease agreement simultaneously.</p>
<p>Sign two original copies of the lease agreement so that both you and the other party have one for reference and record.</p>

<p>Dear Mary,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve learned that you are busy preparing for the CET-4 examination.and I‚Äôve noticed it is extremely difficult for you. So now I am wrting to put forward my suggestions about preparing for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To begin with, you are supposed to spare at least one hour to practice listening every day since listening proves to be the greatest headache for most college students. While listening.you should take notes and write down the key points. What‚Äôs more, seize every opportunity to speak English. Last but not least, write English compositions and ask your teacher to correct them so as to recognize your shortcomings in writing English.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, what I mentioned above is just my advice on preparing for the CET-4 examination. You have to think independenitly and find out more methods that suit you best. I firmly maintain that through your unremitting efforts, you will pass the exam successfully.</p>

<p>Developing Electric Cars</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The electric car is an inspiring invention. Currently, the govemment is attaching more and more importanice to the development of electric cars.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not hard for us to find the reasons why priority is given to electric cars. The primary reason, I think, lies in the fact that electric cars can save nonrenewable gasoline, which will somewhat lessen the pressure of energy crisis. The second reason is that electric cars also contribute to environmental protection if we take into consideration the fact that they release no fumes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that consumers are still in favor of cars powered by gasoline, the government should take measures to promote the development and the use of electric cars. The government can invest more money in the development of electric cars. In addition, the publicity and education of environmental protection should be strengthened to enhance people‚Äôs awareness of environmental protection.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Zhang</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to express my apologies to you for not being able to keep our 10 o‚Äôclock appointment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason why I didn‚Äôt keep the promise is that I witnessed a traffic accident on my way to school. The victim was a school girl. She was hit by a car from the back and fell down her bicycle. She was badly injured and lay unconsciously on the side of the road.It was annoying that the car driver just ran away after hitting the girl. Several kind-hearted passersby and I eventually took the poor girl to the hospital.</p>

<p>I will come over to your apartment the day after tomorrow, Tuesday, Feb 26th, at 9 o‚Äôclock in the morming if that is convenient for you. Sorry again.</p>
